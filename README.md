It's nice to meet you. Enjoy your stay~
I'm a Full-stack developer graduated from a 3-year college program with an eye for ethical hacking, game development and software development. If I had to rank my interests, it would be:<br>  
1. Cybersecurity<br>
2. Game Development<br>
3. Software Development<br>
This list is not set in stone and what I like changes from time to time. I like all 3 of them still.
Content creation is also part of my plans and possibly other things that I have floating in my head. There's a lot going through my thoughts about projects, so right now it's more of a sorting them out. As of now, I am focused on learning and developing more with the help of Udemy courses. Currently job seeking/Freelancing.</p>

- <b>Hobbies :</b>soccer, saxophone, PC Building, filming, photography, gaming, streaming. I would include drawing, pen spinning and graphic design, however I haven't practiced enough, but they do interest me among other things. I'll keep this list short.
<br>
- <b>Watch :</b>Mainly anime, YouTube, documentaries. I highly recommend Peaky Blinders which is one of the few non-anime shows I thoroughly enjoyed.<br>
- <b>Music :</b> It's complicated... (meme reference). Eurobeat, vocaloid, Phonk, Hard Phonk, Lo-Fi, Instrumental Rap Beats, Classical and many more.<br><br><br>

- 🔭 Currently working on a MERN Full-stack project
- 🌱 Presently learning C++ and almost done with the online course
- 👯 Seeking to collaborate on content creation and/or development projects
- 💬 Ask me about anything really, I'm pretty open
- ⚡ Fun fact: **major** car enthusiast and some co-workers found it weird that a developer would also be into cars lol.

I have no idea. I hope it's not idiotic. Probably not the best way to come up with a name, but considering I've been using this name for so long it just stuck with me at this point and I like it. Just a little fun story if you were curious.（*＾-＾*）</details>

*Note: some of the images link to where I learned about the language or tool. Those with no links are what I learned in College or from a YouTube tutorial and just have a tooltip when you hover over them. I don't remember all of the tutorials I've watched, so some just aren't linked and have an explanation instead.
