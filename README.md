<p>
It's nice to meet you. Enjoy your stay~
I'm a Full-stack developer graduated from a 3-year college program with an eye for ethical hacking, game development and software development. If I had to rank my interests, it would be:<br>  
1. Cybersecurity<br>
2. Game Development<br>
3. Software Development<br>
This list is not set in stone and what I like changes from time to time. I like all 3 of them still.
Content creation is also part of my plans and possibly other things that I have floating in my head. There's a lot going through my thoughts about projects, so right now it's more of a sorting them out. As of now, I am focused on learning and developing more with the help of Udemy courses. Currently job seeking/Freelancing.</p>

- <b>Music :</b>Eurobeat, vocaloid, Phonk, Hard Phonk, Lo-Fi, Instrumental Rap Beats, Classical and many more.<br><br><br>
  
<h3 align="center">˜”*°•.˜”*°• A few more little things: •°*”˜.•°*”˜</h3>

- 🔭 Currently working on a MERN Full-stack project
- 🌱 Presently learning C++ and almost done with the online course
- 👯 Seeking to collaborate on content creation and/or development projects
- 💬 Ask me about anything really, I'm pretty open
- ⚡ Fun fact: **major** car enthusiast and some co-workers found it weird that a developer would also be into cars.

<h3 align="center">˜”*°•.˜”*°• 🧰 Languages, Frameworks and Tools •°*”˜.•°*”˜</h4>
*Note: some of the images link to where I learned about the language or tool. Those with no links are what I learned in College or from a YouTube tutorial and just have a tooltip when you hover over them. I don't remember all of the tutorials I've watched, so some just aren't linked and have an explanation instead.
