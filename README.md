<h2 align="center">Junior Full-stack Developer</h1>

## About me professionally
Full-stack developer graduated from a 3-year college program with an eye for ethical hacking, game development and software development. I'm more interested in the ethical hacking or cybersecurity field overall, but I'm up for anything really.<br>Content creation is also part of my plans and possibly other things that I have floating in my head. There's a lot going through my head about projects, so right now it's more of a sorting them out. As of now, I am focused on learning and developing more with the help of Udemy courses and job seeking.

<details><summary><h3>Where did the name come from?</h3></summary>Very simple, I picked the first name and last name of 2 different characters I liked from 2 anime that I've watched and enjoyed.<br>Does the name mean anything? I have no idea. I hope it's not idiotic. Probably not the best way to come up with a name, but considering I've been using this name for so long it just stuck with me at this point and I like it. Just a little fun story if you were curious.ï¼ˆ*ï¼¾-ï¼¾*ï¼‰</details>

Greetings, if you're wondering about why I'm not using my real name it's because I share this account with people I meet online sometimes and they don't need to know my real identity. That aside, welcome to my github! If you have any questions feel free to email me about it or a LinkedIn message.

A few more little things:

- ðŸ”­ Currently working on a MERN Full-stack project
- ðŸŒ± Presently learning C++ and almost done with the online course
- ðŸ‘¯ Seeking to collaborate on content creation and/or development projects
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything really, I'm pretty open
- âš¡ Fun fact: **major** car enthusiast and some co-workers found it weird that a developer would also be into cars lol.

<summary><h3>About me personally</h3></summary>
>Hobbies?<br>soccer, saxophone, PC Building, filming, photography, gaming, streaming. I would include drawing, pen spinning and graphic design, however I haven't practiced enough, but they do interest me among other things. I'll keep this list short.
<br>>what do I watch?<br>Mainly anime and had random YouTube videos. It's either music or a video about something random or a documentary. There's a few other shows that I've seen that aren't anime like Peeky Blinders and that was a real good show.<br>>What are my music tastes?<br>It's complicated... (meme reference). Seriously though, there's plenty. Here's a few: Eurobeat, vocaloid, Phonk, Hard Phonk, Lo-Fi, Instrumental Rap Beats, Classical, etc...
